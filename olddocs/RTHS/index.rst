Real Time Hydrologic Stations
=============================

In parallel to the adaptive-resolution hydrologic and hydraulic characterization of the watershed, a network of :term:`RTHS` will be deployed across the :term:`LRGV` as a catalyst for inter-jurisdictional collaboration and holistic flood, water quality and ecological management. :term:`RTHS` deployments will be strategically located to serve the following decision making needs:

*   Locations on the main drains and Resaca networks to characterize regional drainage patterns and to promote holistic decision making regarding regional flood-flow routing and siting of Regional Detention Facilities.
*   Local, off-mainstem locations to provide flood-front early warning for localities experiencing recurring flooding, and to validate catchment-scale hydraulic models used for design development of structural controls such as high-volume pumping and major diversion structure or culverts.

The combination of adaptive resolution forecasting and validation with RTHS data will provide high confidence in early warnings. Further, as has been used in other water management domains (drinking water distribution and wastewater collection), deviations between model forecasts and RTHS data can be used to identify impending structural failures.

The RTHS deployments will be served by the :term:`REON` Cyberinfrastructure :term:`REON.cc` that has been in continuous operation for 15 years, currently serving over 70 :term:`RTHS` in providing real time decision support hydrologic and water quality data to local, regional and state decision makers.

RTHS sensors and base stations are designed, developed and deployed by :term:`RATES` with a primary vision of “democratizing water intelligence” by making them affordable to small organizations. This is accomplished by reducing the component and life cycle of the incorporated technologies without sacrificing reliability, accuracy and precision. Operational costs are further reduced, and deployment sustainability is maximized by providing deployment strategies via a membership subscription model. This affords member entities turnkey solutions with nominal initial and ongoing annual investments.

:term:`RTHS` Stations will be installed to locally validate the models developed in Task 1.2 that will rapidly provide the LRGVDC with the framework to support flood mitigation and planning, along with specific applications to impacted localities for capital improvement project design development. Approximately 44 RTHS deployments are anticipated across the LRGV, with approximately 1/3 being deployed to characterize catchment hydraulics (identified in Task 2.1) along with flood early warning. :term:`REON` network sustainability is promoted by recruiting jurisdictions local to each installation to absorb the stations annual maintenance costs beyond the project performance period.
