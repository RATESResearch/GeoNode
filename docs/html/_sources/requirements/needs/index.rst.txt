End-User Needs Identification
=============================

.. ifnotslides::

   Based on feedback during initial end-user meetings, the Figure: REON.cc Information Flow depicts the information flow necessary to meet the end-user needs. End-user needs are, in order of priority:

			1.  **Hydrologic Extremes**: Immediate needs for REON.cc are to support policy and operational decision making for **flood response and resiliency**. Shortly after flood management application, user is expected to need inclusion of **drought preparedness and management** as core functionality.

   2.  **Water Supply**: As support is provided for floods and droughts, decision makers are expected to turn their attention to utilizing REON.cc for water supply applications, including mid-term **storage predictions** and **inter-basin transfer** decisions.

   3.  **Ecosystem Services**: Increased expansion of water supply needs are coupled to **water quality** implications on **source water**. In parallel, applications of REON.cc are expected to expand to address ecosystem services, including **Freshwater** and **instream flows** management.
