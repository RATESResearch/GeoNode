# End-User Needs Identification

Based on feedback during initial end-user meetings, the Figure: REON.cc
Information Flow depicts the information flow necessary to meet the end-user
needs. End-user needs are, in order of priority:

1.  **Hydrologic Extremes**: Immediate needs for REON.cc are to support policy
    and operational decision making for **flood response and resiliency**.
    Shortly after flood management application, user is expected to need
    inclusion of **drought preparedness and management** as core functionality.

2.  **Water Supply**: As support is provided for floods and droughts, decision
    makers are expected to turn their attention to utilizing REON.cc for water
    supply applications, including mid-term **storage predictions** and
    **inter-basin transfer** decisions.

3.  **Ecosystem Services**: Increased expansion of water supply needs are
    coupled to **water quality** implications on **source water**. In parallel,
    applications of REON.cc are expected to expand to address ecosystem
    services, including **Freshwater** and **instream flows** management.
