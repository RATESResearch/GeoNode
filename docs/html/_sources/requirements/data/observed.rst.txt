Observed Data

   Of particular interest is RTHS and **real-time data** from other providers, along with other observations such as **physical grab samples**, **meteorological measurements** and others that could serve as **forcing data** for mechanistic models, analytics and decision support tools.

   -   The current **RTHS database** is CUAHSI ODM 1.1.1 compliant. Additional data is stored in different databases to accommodate the needs of the source data structures.

   -   Where possible **cloud-sourced** data should be retrieved **on demand** rather than being stored locally in order to **ensure currency**. **Caching** and **buffering** technologies should be used to prevent data access **latency** when needed for processing by analytics, visualization and forecast tools.
