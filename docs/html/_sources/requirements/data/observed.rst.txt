Observed Data
-------------

Of particular interest is RTHS and **real-time data** from other providers,
along with other observations such as **physical grab samples**,
**meteorological measurements** and others that could serve as **forcing data**
for mechanistic models, analytics and decision support tools.

.. nextslide::

-   The current **RTHS database** is CUAHSI ODM 1.1.1 compliant. Additional data
    is stored in different databases to accommodate the needs of the source data
    structures.

-   Where possible **cloud-sourced** data should be retrieved **on demand**
    rather than being stored locally in order to **ensure currency**.
    **Caching** and **buffering** technologies should be used to prevent data
    access **latency** when needed for processing by analytics, visualization
    and forecast tools.
