   Most analytic tools are unlikely to require output data storage, as the **computational effort** needed to process the tool are likely to be **nominal**, and as such can be executed **on-demand**, allowing for outputs reflective of the current state of available data.

   -   For **example**, a simple analytic tool that takes stage height data from hydrologically connected RTHS stations, and produces travel time estimates between the two, produces a single data point for each execution.

   -   Both the computational **cost** and the storage cost are **nominal**.

   -   However, travel time **estimates** for two RTHS stations can **change over time** as the bathymetry of the intervening channel evolves, and under deferring upstream and downstream flow conditions.

   -   **Storage** of the different travel time estimates **can be useful over time** to provide insights into the changing topography of the region.
