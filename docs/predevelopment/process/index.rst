      :term:`RGVFlood` Development process

   :numref:`process` depicts the anticipated development process for the :term:`RGVFlood` user interface as punctuated by other activities. *Hydrologic Model Code Deployment* characterizes the information storage and processing requirements for the Tier I hydrologic model that will eventually be integrated into :term:`RGVFlood`.  This, along with the Tier II, III and IV models, and end-user *Requirements* udergo a *Validation* process through a series of workshops.

   Parallel to this process is the identification of the optimal locations for siting the :term:`RTHS` stations to provide forcing data for the models, along with end-user expectations of :term:`RTHS` data. This information feeds the *RTHS Deployment* process in parallel with the usr interface *Pre-Development* plan formulation.

   With a *Pre-Development* plan in place, *Implementation* of the user interface begins. As :term:`RTHS` stations get deployed, and *Data Assimilation* into the :term:`RGVFlood` cyberinfrastructure begins, the user interface *Implementation* is expected to evolve to adapt to new potential applications and adjustments.

   *Quality Assurance* demonstration of the operational integrity of the interface components, as well as identification of methodologies for capturing un-intended outcomes will involve end-user *Workshops*. This process, akin to *alpha* testing, will result in further refinements to the user-interface and linkages to the underlying data and models.

   A *beta* testing phase will run parallel to the initial Tier I *Hydrologic Model Execution*, allowing for tighter integration of the user interface with live forecast data. This process will culminate in end-user acceptance of the user interface, and operational deployment.
