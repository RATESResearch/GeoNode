      :term:`RGVFlood` Development timeline

   :numref:`timeline` depicts the anticipated development timeline for the :term:`RGVFlood` user interface. *Notice to Proceed* was issued on October 6, 2020, and work immediately began on *Model Code Deployment*. Sufficient information had already been collected on the model resource needs to begin refinement of the *User Interface Requirements Determination*. *Requirements Determination* efforts had begun well before the project conception, as a result of years of interaction with stakeholders in the region. Validation of the requirements through a series of *End User Data Dictionary Workshops*, along with the production of the *Pre-Development Paln*,  was therefore able to be completed within a relatively short timeframe.

   Implementation of the refinements to instantiate the :term:`RGVFlood` user interface has already begun, and is expected to be completed by mid-February, after which, *Quality Assurance* efforts will begin, with an end-user workshop being conducted in conjunction with the *Local Data Characterization Workshop* to be scheduled in early March. *End-User Acceptance* testing will commence the following month, with formal *Deployment* anticipated by May.
