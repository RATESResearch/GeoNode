       RGVFlood Use Cases

   :numref:`rgvflood-use-cases` depicts the most commonly anticipated user-cases for :term:`RGVFlood`. The primary intended use for :term:`RGVFlood` is to facilitate multi-jurisdictional decision making, with jurisdictions of varying sizes, needs and capacities being able to participate with equal impact or influence. Represented in :numref:`rgvflood-use-cases` are 2 jurisdictions, *JurisdictionA* and *JurisdictionB*. *JurisdictionA* represents a local government with significant capacity, including in-house engineering, whereas *JurisdictionB* represents one of lesser capacity or resources, where the elected officials perform operational duties in addition to decision and/or policy-making. *JurisdictionB* also relies on consultants for engineering services. Within each jurisdiction are also local or regional planners, and first responders and/or emergency managers.

   Decision makers are typically elected officials on whom the burden of inter-jurisdictional decision making rests. While their primary responsibility is to the constituents who elected them to public office, effective flood management requires 

   Decision Makers
       Elected officials responsible for regional policy making and recruitment of state & federal funds.

   Planners
       Jurisdictional and multi-jurisdictional planners needing to make both operational and strategic decisions in coordination with Elected officials.

   Federal Agencies
       Agencies such as :term:`FEMA` and :term:`NWS` that provide financial and technical resources for flood response, recovery & resiliency planning.

   State Agencies
       Agencies such as :term:`TGLO` and :term:`TWDB` that provide financial and technical resources for flood response, recovery & resiliency planning.

   First Responders
       Emergency Management Agencies and First Responders utilizing Early Warning information generated by the :term:`RTHS` stations themselves, or from :term:`REON.cc` utilizing higher order analytics.

   Engineers
       Both public sector and private sector engineers, relying on the :term:`REON/WM` Tier II (:term:`HEC-RAS`), Tier III (:term:`HEC-HMS`) & Tier IV (:term:`SWMM`) supported models for design development or review.

   Researchers
       Research engineers and hydrologists are likely use the :term:`REON/WM` :term:`WRF-Hydro` instance directly, along with real time data from :term:`RTHS.us`.
