Cyberinfrastructure
===================

In order to effectively develop an adaptive regional strategy, and to implement as suite of currently identified specific flood protection projects, the :term:`LRGVDC` will adopt the established :term:`REON.cc` as the cyber-infrastructure house relevant hydrographic data. REON is a network of local government entities that share hydrographic data and hydrologic information to facilitate policy and decision making across inter-dependent jurisdictions. :term:`REON` consists of a cloud-enabled :term:`GIS`, supported by a growing network of :term:`RTHS`, with embedded analytics and decision support tools, allowing jurisdictional partners to share information, and maintain offline mirrors for local operations and archival. The :term:`REON` framework facilitates multi-partner, asynchronous (e.g. local developer) contributions to the community data, providing the basis for ordnance enabled data upkeep and enhancement. For example, hydrographic data can be integrated by developers, regulators or community organizations as local projects dictate its production, such as :term:`H&H` models that demonstrate compliance with drainage ordinances. The existing :term:`REON.cc` cyberinfrastructure will be extended to incorporate both on demand and real-time hydrologic and hydraulic model forecast and hindcast capability for each of the 40 watersheds, sub-watersheds and catchments defined in Task 1.2. In addition to embedding the hydrologic and hydraulic model frameworks to be used, geo-spatial data validation procedures will be implemented to ensure seamless execution by non-technical users for decision support.
