Purpose of Tier I Modeling
==========================

The :term:`LRGV` is divided into 4 primary, man-made or controlled, drainage pathways moving water from west to east into the Lower Laguna Madrea. From north to south these are:

* Raymondville Drain  
* Hidalgo/Willacy Drain  
* :term:`USIBWC` North Floodway
* Arroyo Colorado

Southeast of the Arroyo Colorado is a complex drainage area that includes diffuse overland flow patterns in the Laguna Atascosa, an intricate network of Resacas and the Brownsville Ship Channel. The southern-most border of the :term:`LRGV` is comprised of the Lower Rio Grande River.

These constitute the primary pathways for moving flood waters from the western portion of the :term:`LRGV` into the Lower Laguna Madre. Because the drainage and irrigation system is so anthropogenically modified, and the terrain is so flat, changes in one drainage pathway (e.g. expansion, adding lateral storage, etc) can have a significant effect on the others. It is therefore important that the hydrology of the region be characterized as a single integrated flow network, but as it pertains to channel modifications and to flow distribution responses to sudden changes in inputs (e.g. storms).

Regional flow patterns in the :term:`LRGV` are heavily influenced by the configuration and trajectory of the forcing storm. Hurricanes Dolly (2008), Alex(2010) and Hanna (2020) all impacted the :term:`LRGV` from different directions,each triggering different compounding effects based on their entrypoint, duration and precipitation intensity. Storm surge impacts along the coastline of the :term:`LRGV` are simliarly influenced by their trajectory into and over the Lower Laguna Madre.

The :term:`LRGV` has experienced anthropogenic modification of its hydrology since the early 1900s when the area was intensively manipulated with irrigation ditches to support crop production. As a result the traditional definition of a watershed has limited bearing, with topographically defined basin boundaries being bisected by irrigation and drianage ditches. This, coupled with locally manipulated reservoirs and control structures, results in often unpredictable local flow patterns, with laterals experiencing flow reversal based on both upstream and downstream controls. The impact of these local flow patterns on region flow is unknown, but attempts at understanding this can be achieved by coupling regional hydrological predictions with subregional hydraulic modeling to ascertain the impact of regional discharge dynamics on sub-regional hydrodynamics.
