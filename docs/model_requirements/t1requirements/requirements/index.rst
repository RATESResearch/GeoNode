Requirements
============

The core requirements of the :term:`Tier I` modeling framework are:

*   Provide regional discharge forecasts:
    
    *   For use by the :term:`Tier II` modeling framework for refined water surface elevation analysis, scour and energy transfer estimations needed for design of engineered mitigation project.
    *   For use by rapid estimations of forecast inundation using tools such as the :term:`HAND` model for both emergency response preparedness and damage estimations.

*   Characterize regional flow patterns to promote the development of both structural and nono-structural regional approaches to flood management

*   Serve as the basis for mid-term water supply planning and management

*   Serve as the basis for long-term environmental and ecosystem planning and management
