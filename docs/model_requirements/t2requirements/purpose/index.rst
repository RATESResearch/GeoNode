Purpose of Tier II Modeling
===========================

The purpose of Tier II modeling is to characterize and forecast hydraulic and hydrodynamic conditions at the sub-basin scale. In the context of RGVFlood, sub-basins are determined to be sized between 12 and 10-digit :term:`USGS`  :term:`HUC` s. From the end user's perpective, Tier II modeling will provide the following information:

* Water surface information, both in-channel and over-bank if conditions warrant
* Hydraulic energy transmission at sensitive locations (bridges, culverts, etc) under various flow conditions
* Data gap analysis providing information regarding locations and conditions that would measurably improve system characterization.
