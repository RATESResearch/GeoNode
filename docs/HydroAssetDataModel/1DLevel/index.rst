One- D Levels
======

Levels concept is to provide the best HEC-RAS model with the existing to collected data where:
 * Level 0 = Elevation Models/Cross_Section from USGS QUAD DEM or NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 2000  released globally 2015.
 * Level 1 = National/State/Local Elevation from LiDAR tied to local datum
 * Level 2 = Elevation from Unmanned Aircraft System tied to local daturm
 * Level 3 = Elevation from Hybrid UAS/LiDAR/Surv tied to local datum
 * Level 4 = Elevation from Land Survey methods tied to local daturm
 
Hydro Asset Data Model
=======
Creation of the terrain files and cross sections needed in HEC-RAS can occur in HEC Terrain or in AutoCAD. This Hydro Asset Data Model will provide guidence on obtaining the need data sets for HEC RAS Analysis
