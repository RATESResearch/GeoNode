Introduction
=============

This research document summarizes the Hydrological Asset Data Model HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's (HEC) River Analysis System software (RAS) HEC-RAS:

  ** one-dimensional (1D) Steady and Unsteady
  ** two-dimensional (2D) Unsteady Flow.

Hydrological Asset Data Model includes the files to make a HEC-RAS 1D and 2D analysis that includes:
 ** HEC-RAS project file (*.prj)
 ** Geometry file (*.g01)
 ** Unsteady flow file (*.u01)
 ** Plan file (*.p01)
 ** RAS Mapper file (*.rasmapper)

This document is not intended to replace the HEC-RAS documentation at the US Army Corps of Engineers at https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/documentation.aspx
