Using terrain data from both LiDAR and grading objects, this class will demonstrate how 1D and 2D hydraulic floodplain simulations can be quickly created from AutoCAD Civil 3D designs. With DEM terrain aggregation and geometric editing functionalities recently added in the newest releases of HEC-RAS version 5.0.7 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, this class will focus on techniques and nuances for setting up your HEC-RAS model and getting simulated results back into AutoCAD Civil 3D for the creation of detailed work maps. Utilizing only AutoCAD Civil 3D and open-source programs, this class will demonstrate how to successfully integrate HEC-RAS simulations with AutoCAD Civil 3D. 

Existing Hydro Assets can be drawn in HEC RAS.  Using surveying point cloulds geometry can be determined.

Civil3D can be used for:
 * Existing topography has been acquired and an existing surface has been created in Civil3D
 * A proposed roadway corridor and corresponding Civil3D surface has been created
 * Proposed culverts have been drawn as Civil3D Pipe Networks.
 * Grading for the proposed encroaching fill is has been created as a Civil3D surface

When reporting Hydro Asset you should use HEC RAS Geometry Data format.
