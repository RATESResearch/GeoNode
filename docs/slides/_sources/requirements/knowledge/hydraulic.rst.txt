Hydraulic Modeling
------------------

Hydraulic modeling is typically differentiated from Hydrologic Modeling in that
formulations balance system energy rather than mass. This is typically required
in situations where the timescales of transport and transformation phenomena are
short.

Some key elements of hydrologic modeling include:

-   Conservation of Energy: A focus on balancing energy in the system.

-   Mechanistic Processes: Hydraulic systems are often represented as
    combinations of Mechanistic processes.

-   Hydraulic Models: Several hydraulic models were considered for initial
    incorporation into the REON/WM, including:

    -   HEC-RAS

    -   SPRNT

    -   Primo

**Tier II On-Demand Hydraulic Modeling**: HEC-RAS was selected for initial deployment in the REON/WM as the Tier II model because:

-   It is extensively used by practitioners

-   Though closed-source, it is freely available for use by end-users.

-   It enjoys strong and stable development support by the USACE/HEC
