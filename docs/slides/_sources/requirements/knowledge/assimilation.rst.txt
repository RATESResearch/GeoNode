Assimilation
------------

The Assimilation tools are used import or transform Observed Data into the
required format for ingestion into Analytics or other Forecasting tools. The key
application is for "nudging" deterministic tools using timely forcing data.

-   They include routines that retrieve and ingest domain and forcing data for
    the mechanistic forecasting tools.

-   Processing capacity needs can be significant, and can increase exponentially
    with the scale of the domain

-   Storage needs can be orders of magnitude greater than the input Data and
    Information used, especially with time-variant computations.

-   Reduction of output storage needs can be significantly reduced by
    transforming it through analytic tools.
