Crowdsource Data
----------------

Effective data input will rely on a **balance** between **quality assured** data
from known sources, to **crowdsourced** data, that while potentially meeting
only nominal quality assurance standards, may often be of **higher volumes** and
potentially possess **unique intrinsic value**.

-   Crowdsource data can consume **significant storage capacity**.

-   For example, **photographs** from **social media** platforms, **geolocated**
    and **time-stamped** have been shown to provide potentially **quantitative**
    insights into flood inundation depths to **correlate** against
    **forecasting** tools.
