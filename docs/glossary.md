# Glossary

Bernoulli
> The Bernoulli equation is a simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations assuming inviscid fluid and steady (non-time-variant) flow.

COP
> Common Operating Picture

Crowdsource
> Data collection from open, relatively un-controlled, sources.

CUAHSI
> Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science

Deterministic
> Approaches to describing processes that do not rely on randomness.

Mechanistic
> Formulations describing physical, biological or chemical processes based on a theoretical understanding.

Navier-Stokes
> The Navierâ€“Stokes equations are mathematically representations of conservation of mass and momentum for simple fluids such as water.

Stochastic
> Approaches to describing processes in statistical terms.
