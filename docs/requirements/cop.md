## The Need for a Common Operating Picture

Figure: Blind Men and Elephant depicts old Indian **fable of the Six Blind Men**
and the Elephant, apropos to the issues of developing of water policy or
collaborative decision making. Each stakeholder or decision maker views the
water “elephant” from their own **parochial perspective**, and argues that
theirs is reality. Being able to provide a **Common Operating Picture** is
critical is multi-jurisdictional decision making is to be both effective and
sustainable. COP has been adopted by several agencies including the DHS and
NOAA's NWS. COP is a Situational Awareness capability designed to ensure that
all participating stakeholder and/or **decision makers possess** the full suite
of **information necessary** for the job at hand.
