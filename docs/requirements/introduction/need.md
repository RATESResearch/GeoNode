## Need & Philosophical Basis for REON.cc

REON.cc is the user interface for REON. REON, a flagship program of RATES, is
dedicated to the core philosophy of:

*Democratizing Water Intelligence for Knowledge-Enabled Policy & Decision
Making*

Figure: DIKW Pyramid depicts the Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom pyramid
espoused by the informatics discipline. As adopted by REON, DIKW refers to:

-   **Data**: Addressing the monitoring needs of under-served areas to ensure
    technology and monitoring solutions are available to all.

-   **Information**: Translating water & environmental data into actionable
    intelligence.

-   **Knowledge**: Educating decision makers and elected officials to promote
    knowledge-based decision making.

-   Wisdom: Supporting implementation through facilitation of collaborative
    efforts between stakeholders such as municipalities, academic institutions,
    not-for-profits, conservancy & environmental groups as well as state and
    federal regulatory agencies.
