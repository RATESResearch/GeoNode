Introduction
=============
Geospatial data should be provided in a format consistent with the current Survey Manual. 
Field surveys are performed to collect information that is needed as input into the hydraulic models for Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk and may be needed for SFHAs with moderate flood risk. The field-surveyed data may include information for the following types of features:

 -	Cross Sections
 - 	Transects
 -  Temporary Bench Marks
 -	High Water Marks
 - 	Structures
 -- 	Bridges
 --	Channels
 --	Culverts
 --	Dams
 --	Levees
 --	Coastal Structures
