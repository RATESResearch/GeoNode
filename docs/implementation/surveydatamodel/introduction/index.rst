Introduction
=============
Geospatial data should be provided in a format consistent with the current Survey Manual. 

Field surveys are performed to collect information that is needed as input into the hydraulic models for Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk and may be needed for SFHAs with moderate flood risk. The field-surveyed data may include information for the following types of features:

 -	Cross Sections
 - 	Transects
 -  Temporary Bench Marks
 -	High Water Marks
 - 	Structures
  - 	Bridges
  -	Channels
  -	Culverts
  -	Dams
  -	Levees
  -	Coastal Structures

Survey data files should be stored in a comma delimited text file, spreadsheet, or database format and include all hydraulic feature data and benchmarks surveyed for that stream. 

The file should be developed in a format that includes data that correspond to the fields in the Geospatial Data Model section.

When gathering survey data for a flood study, it is best to organize data collection activities prior to initiating survey activities in the field. As part of the reconnaissance process, Mapping Partners should review all the stream names to determine the best way to name the files and streams. 

Before collecting survey data, shall use the  naming and location for each hydraulic feature to be surveyed for Project Names.
