CAD Data Models
===============

The prupose of Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) Data Models is to poster consistent drafting, graphical representation, and CAD standards for surveying and modeling surveying and engineering documents. The 
information contained herein specifically applies to drawing deliverable requirements for RATES projects  (i.e., file naming conventions, sheet layouts, exported digital document files (PDF, DWF) and DWG output from native CAD software or exports from GIS or BIM software.

Drawing Deliverable Formats and Versions
----------------------------------------

Drawing Deliverable Requirements (DDR) refers to the general standards and requirements of the United States National CAD StandardÂ® (NCS) and only amends the content therein when necessary. 

AutoDESK AutoCAD DWG file formats for deliverables must be fully compatible within one version of the  latest release of AutoCAD. Each DWG representing a sheet must be fully self-contained and all references and/or links bound. All 2D drawing files must be submitted in PDF 1.5 (or greater) file format, per ISO 32000-2 standard. All digital PDFs must be created directly from the native application (e.g. Revit, AutoCAD, Word, etc.).  Drawing line work must be vector based and scale independent.

Companion Files or Exteranl Reference Files
--------------------------------------------

Often CAD has external references files (XREF) and data reference files (DREF) attched to the DWG such as:
 - Project Files
 - Objects
 - Images
 - GIS
 - Other CAD Files
 - Survey Databases SQL
 - DTM, DSM, TIM, GRID, DEM, SDF, MBD, ASC, XML, RAW, CSV, PDF
 - Reports, Spreadsheets, Oject Sets

All files must follow DDR and be provied when sharing or providing a delieverable which include:
- Drawing Naming
- Coordinate System
- Layers
- Styles
- Drafting Conventions
- Plottying
