GPS on Benchmarks
=================

The purpose is ....

  - Automatic generation of 2020.0 Reference Epoch Coordinates (REC) upon release of modernized NSRS and eventual generation and release of Survey Epoch Coordinates
  - Local improvements to the 2022 Transformation Tool, which will enable conversions from current vertical datums to the North American-Pacific Geopotential Datum of 2022 (NAPGD2022) and will be integrated into the NGS Coordinate Conversion and Transformation Tool (NCAT).
  - Update Passive Control Status: mark recoveries and shared solutions provide NGS and other users of the NSRS with insight into the health of the passive control network and updated information for project planning.
  - Tie your local control stations to the NSRS
  - RTN Check Stations â€“ Get updated coordinates on marks in your area for field checks of RTN rovers to ensure consistency with NSRS coordinates
