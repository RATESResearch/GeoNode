Regional Hydrology and Hydraulics
=================================

Through the :term:`RWRAC`, a :term:`H&H` study, greater in local detail and scope to Watershed Assessments conducted by the :term:`USACE` under Section 729 of :term:`WRDA` of 1986 as well as addressing two of the three major phases of a :term:`FEMA` flood study ‐ i.e. assessing the flows through a hydrologic study, and determining flood elevations and floodway via a hydraulic analysis. A suite of geographically dispersed, adaptive‐resolution hydrologic and hydrodynamic models will be developed in parallel to projects identified in Task 2.1 to support flood mitigation planning. Approximately 40 hydrologic units will be characterizedand modeled, ranging in geographic scope from HUC8 to HUC16, with hydraulic modeling to be conducted on a subset of each sub‐watershed, but constrained to a catchment scale defined by the projects identified in Task 2.1 (Project Identification).Costs associated with this task are primarily supplies, equipment and time‐and‐effort expended on data collection, model development, calibration and validation.
