This version of <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-RGVFlood.com\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">RGVFlood.com</span></a> was based on <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-0\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">GeoNode</span></a> v3.3.2, with additional enhancements, including integration of an <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-API\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">API</span></a> for ingestion of timeseries <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-RTHS\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">RTHS</span></a> data, a \u2018Flood Wizard\u2019 app for visualizing data and a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-H-H\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">H&amp;H</span></a> model availability. After operating for 6 months, it was determined that installation on a single bare-metal server was insufficient for the anticipated  demand, and the base software suite upon which <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-RGVFlood.com\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">RGVFlood.com</span></a> was constructed, limited the implementation of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pathways for the already integrated extension and planned extensions - specifically those associated with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-H-H\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">H&amp;H</span></a> model execution.</p>\n<p>In the Spring of 2022, the beta site was decommissioned to allow for spin-up of a re-incarnation of <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-RGVFlood.com\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">RGVFlood.com</span></a> addressing the key issues identified during beta deployment:</p>\n<ol class=\"arabic simple\">\n<li><p>Migration from a single-stack <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-Docker\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">Docker</span></a> container deployment, to a scalable <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-Kubernetes\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">Kubernetes</span></a> cluster.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reliance on an inter-pod shared, cloud-based <span class=\"xref std std-term\">NFS</span> volume service to ensure expansion and accomodation of the large volumes of geospatial data to be stored, and that produces by the integrated <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-H-H\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">H&amp;H</span></a> and visualization tools.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reliance on a managed cloud-served database service, to ensure minimal data access bottle-necks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Integration of <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-0\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">GeoNode</span></a> v4.0 to promote future growth and seamless conntinuous deployment.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n", "metatags": "<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"Docutils 0.17.1: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/\" />\n", "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["euidev/development/index", "Development Infrastructure", "N", "next"], ["euidev/index", "RGVFlood End-User Interface Development", "P", "previous"]], "sourcename": "euidev/background/index.rst.txt", "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">Background</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "display_toc": false, "page_source_suffix": ".rst", "current_page_name": "euidev/background/index", "sidebars": ["about.html", "navigation.html", "relations.html", "searchbox.html", "donate.html", "postcard.html", "recentposts.html", "tagcloud.html", "categories.html", "archives.html"], "customsidebar": null, "favicon_url": null, "logo_url": null, "alabaster_version": "0.7.12"}
