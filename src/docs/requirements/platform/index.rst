=======================

.. ifnotslides::

   The current implementation of REON.cc (Figure: REON.cc User Interface) utilizes a nominally modified instance of the **Open Source** Geospatial Content Management System GeoNode. From the provider:

   *GeoNode is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI).*

   *It is designed to be extended and modified, and can be integrated into existing platforms.*

   With a **robust user-management system**, integration with the well-established GeoServer **geospatial data server** platform for hosting GIS data, and reliance on the Django web framework for the Python programming language, GeoNode isideally suited to being adapted for addressing the Goals and Objectives of the REON.cc platform.
