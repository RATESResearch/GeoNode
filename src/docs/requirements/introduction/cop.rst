   Apropos to the issues of developing of water policy or collaborative decision
   making, each stakeholder or decision maker views the
   water “elephant” from their own **parochial perspective**, and argues that
   theirs is reality. Being able to provide a **Common Operating Picture** is
   critical if multi-jurisdictional decision making is to be both effective and
   sustainable. :term:`COP` has been adopted by several agencies including the :term:`DHS` and
   :term:`NOAA`'s :term:`NWS`. :term:`COP` is a Situational Awareness capability
   designed to ensure that
   all participating stakeholder and/or **decision makers possess** the full suite
   of **information necessary** for the job at hand.
