Conclusions
============

#. Migration from a single-stack :term:`Docker` container deployment, to a scalable :term:`Kubernetes` cluster.
#. Reliance on an inter-pod shared, cloud-based :term:`NFS` volume service to ensure expansion and accomodation of the large volumes of geospatial data to be stored, and that produces by the integrated :term:`H&H` and visualization tools.
#. Reliance on a managed cloud-served database service, to ensure minimal data access bottle-necks.
#. Integration of :term:`GeoNode` v4.0 to promote future growth and seamless conntinuous deployment.
