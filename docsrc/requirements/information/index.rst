Information
===========

**Information** is a key product of REON.cc. It results from the transformation of raw data into actionable intelligence.

-   Processing capacity needs are driven by the complexity and volume of data
    needed for the particular analytic and visualization tool being used, but in
    general, they are significantly lower that the mechanistic tools used in
    Knowledge: Processing Needs.

-   Storage needs for information are driven by the outputs of the analytic and
    procedural tools that act on the raw data.

-   Determination of the need to store these outputs is driven by a balance
    between the computation effort required to reproduce and the volume of
    storage associated with the output data.

-   Some caching and buffering must be considered for remote and cloud-served
    data, such as National data sources, to ensure timely utilization in the
    Processing elements of REON.cc.

-   The REON.cc cyberinfrastructure has been implemented for water quality
    applications (Navarro et al, 2021).
