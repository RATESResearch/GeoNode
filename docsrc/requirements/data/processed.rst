Processed Data
--------------

Processed Data is produced when **raw data** is **transformed** through
**analytic** or **deterministic** tools.

-   Unless carefully produced, processed Data can contribute to extremely **high
    storage** volume needs.

-   **Balancing** the **computational effort** needed to produce the processed
    data against **storage volumes** needed to store it is critical to
    **efficiency**.

-   **Tuning** the **analytic** and **deterministic** tools to limit the
    production of processed data to only that needed to serve the decision
    making end can minimize both processing and storage needs.

.. nextslide::

-   In some cases, **high computational** effort and **high processed storage
    volumes** cannot be avoided, in which case, processed may be **condensed**
    through further analytic processing to reduce the volume of storage needed
    while **maintaining** the **intrinsic value** of the processing.

-   **Caching** should be used to reduce the **volume** for **storage** over
    **time**.
