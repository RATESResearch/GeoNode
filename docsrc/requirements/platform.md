# Platform Identification

The current implementation of REON.cc (Figure: REON.cc User Interface) utilizes
a nominally modified instance of the **Open Source** Geospatial Content
Management System GeoNode. From the provider:

*GeoNode is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial
information systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI).*

*It is designed to be extended and modified, and can be integrated into existing
platforms.*

With a **robust user-management system**, integration with the well-established
GeoServer **geospatial data server** platform for hosting GIS data, and reliance
on the Django web framework for the Python programming language, GeoNode is
ideally suited to being adapted for addressing the Goals and Objectives of the
REON.cc platform.
