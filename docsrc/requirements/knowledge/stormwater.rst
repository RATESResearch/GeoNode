Urban Stormwater Modeling
-------------------------

Urban stormwater modeling typically includes facets of both Hydrologic Modeling
and Hydraulic Modeling, and will often incorporate rudimentary water quality
modeling as well. These models simulate rainfall-runoff, open channel flow and
underground pipe flow to try to capture as much of the urban stormwater
environment as possible. These are complex models requiring a significant amount
of domain data to be effective and useful.

**Tier III Urban Stormwater Modeling**: Due to the complexity of the data requirements, urban stormwater modeling is not
expected to be directly linked or embedded into REON.cc.
